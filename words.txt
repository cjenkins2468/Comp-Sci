collars moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip cricket's bone, lash film,

Made joiner squirrelld grub,

Because breaths sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime gallops'er courtier's nose,

Tickling parson's nose a' lies asleep,

Sometime driveth'er ldier's neck,

Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five-fathom deep;  anon
Drums ear, starts wakes,
being thus frighted swears prayer two

Making women good carriage:

Chorus
Nowld desire doth death-bed lie,
young affection gapes heir;
fair love groan'd die,
With tender Juliet match'd, now fair.
Now Romeo beloved loves again,
Alike betwitched charm looks,
foe supposed must complain,
steal love's sweet bait fearful hooks:
Being held foe, may access
Tbreasuch vows lovers swear;
much love, means much less
Tmeet new-beloved any where:
passion lends power, means, meet
Tempering extremities extreme sweet.

In herbs, plants, stones, true qualities:
For nought  vile earth doth live

Nor aught  good strain'd fair use
Revolts true birth, stumbling abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;

For whose dear sake thou wast lately dead;
There art thou happy: Tybalt kill thee,

Happiness courts thee best array;
But, misbehaved sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thytune thy love:
Take heed, take heed, such die miserable.
Go, get thee thy love, decreed,
Ascend chamber, hence comfort her:
